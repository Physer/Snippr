# Snippr
--------

## Introduction
Snippr is a tool to collect your code snippets.
Ever had that problem that you would know you've coded something before that you can use but you don't know where it is?
Snippr solves that.

You can categorize, tag and save your code snippets in this tool.

## Summary
This repository contains the API for Snippr.
It can be connected to the official Snippr Frontend or to a custom frontend of your own choosing.

It's developed with .NET's Web API 2.
For data storage it fully uses [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) by Elastic.
This also makes it possible to quickly search for code.

## Installation
